## Release packaging and crates.io readiness

Purpose: Binary crates must commit Cargo.lock for reproducible builds. Cargo.toml
is missing metadata needed for crates.io. License file doesn't match declared dual
license.

Planned fix:
- Remove Cargo.lock from .gitignore, commit it
- Add `rust-version = "1.85"` to Cargo.toml
- Add `repository`, `keywords`, `categories`, `readme` to Cargo.toml
- Either add LICENSE-APACHE or change to `license = "MIT"` only
- Add release CI workflow: build binaries on tag push (Linux/macOS/Windows)
