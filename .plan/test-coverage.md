## Test coverage for untested modules

Purpose: Core modules lib.rs, theme.rs, and gloss/filter.rs have zero tests. The Config layering logic, color
conversion, theme discovery, and filter pipeline are all unverified. Integration tests directory is empty.

Planned tests:

- lib.rs: Config::load() with layered overrides, color parsing edge cases, ratatui\_to\_termcolor round-trip,
  workspace\_root directory traversal, resolve\_file search order
- theme.rs: load\_themes() discovery across directories, fallback to default
- gloss/filter.rs: stdin→stdout pipeline (may need exploration on how to test interactive TUI code)
- Integration tests: plan add/open/delete lifecycle, gloss file viewing
