## Error handling: eliminate panics in user-facing code

Purpose: Several code paths use expect() which panics instead of showing user-friendly
errors. Broken pipe (plan list | head) causes panic. Library code calls process::exit()
which couples it to CLI behavior.

Planned fix:
- `open_task()`: use Command::status() match instead of expect() when gloss not found
- `init_plan()`: propagate errors with Result instead of expect()
- `write_colored!` macro: use let _ = or ok() for I/O calls
- `list_tasks()`: return Result instead of calling process::exit()
- `filter::run_filter`: either implement ANSI color output or remove no_color flag
  (needs exploration — ratatui can't emit ANSI to stdout, may need termcolor bridge)
